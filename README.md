<h3 align="center">I'm a frontend developer based in Dublin. I have always been passionate about technology and its endless possibilities to create meaningful and innovative solutions. My journey into the world of tech started when I made a career transition from fraud analysis to programming. While working in fraud analysis, I realized my interest and aptitude for coding and problem-solving. This realization led me to pursue a career in programming, where I could channel my passion for technology into building user-friendly and impactful applications. As a frontend developer, I enjoy crafting elegant and responsive user interfaces that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience. I love diving into the latest web development technologies and frameworks, constantly expanding my skill set to stay up-to-date with industry trends. Living in Dublin provides me with a vibrant tech community and endless opportunities to collaborate with like-minded professionals. Whether it's attending meetups, participating in hackathons, or exploring the city's thriving tech scene, I am always eager to immerse myself in the world of technology and contribute to its growth and innovation. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new coding projects, exploring the outdoors, or enjoying a good book at a cozy cafÃ©. I'm excited about the future of technology and the endless possibilities it holds, and I look forward to continuing my journey as a frontend developer in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.</h3>
